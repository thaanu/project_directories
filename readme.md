# Project Folder Creator

This application creates a project directory and creates the folder sturcture accordingly.

### How to configure the environment file:
Initially you will not see the `.env` file in the current project directory. You can either create this file manually by copying content from `.sample-env`, or when the application starts this will be be created with initial values.

**Main Environment Variables**
